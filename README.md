## Online image resizer

- resize.py will prompt the user for an image's url 
- the following prompt asks for scale to reduce by (0.0 < scale < 1.0)
- local uploads possible too


- TODO: 
  - batch url upload (or loop wtih current single-upload function)
  - look into discord integration
  - option to choose local or remote upload
  - while loop / input validation
